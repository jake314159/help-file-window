#Introduction

The file with the lowest number index will be shown when the user first opens up the help file window. This file can be used for some very basic help information but any detailed help information should have it's own file so it is easier for the user to find the one bit of information that they need.

Other things which could be included are
+ Contact details of the developer
+ Copyright notices
+ A description of what the program does
