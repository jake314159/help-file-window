#Help 1

Here is the first help file which the user can reach by clicking on the button marked "Help 1" on the sidebar. These files should include more detailed information about the type of information described in the title.

It is important that the title of each file is descriptive to help ensure that it is easy for the user to find the piece of information that they want. Remember this is where the user comes if they are confused so it should be simple to search through the topics available.
